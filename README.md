An Android app built using Kotlin and clean MVVM architecture to call [PokedexApi](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/)

 This app is build using jetpack compose for UI.

## additional things you can do
 since this app was created for purpose of learning jetpack compose there other additional things we didn't put much focus on:
1. Upgrade the app to use  [flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow) and [livedata](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) , however this app follows the MVVM architecture 
2. Upgrade to use new jetpack compose paging library

## Tech Stack
 
 - [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) - Jetpack Compose is Androidâ€™s modern toolkit for building native UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android. Quickly bring your app to life with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.

 - [Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle) - Lifecycle-aware components perform actions in response to a change in the lifecycle status of another component, such as activities and fragments. These components help you produce better-organized, and often lighter-weight code, that is easier to maintain.
 
 - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) -The ViewModel class is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.
 
 - [Dagger Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) - A dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in your project.
  
 - [Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/kotlin) - Kotlin is a programming language that can run on JVM. Google has announced Kotlin as one of its officially supported programming languages in Android Studio; and the Android community is migrating at a pace from Java to Kotlin.
